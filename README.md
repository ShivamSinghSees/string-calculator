## String Calculator - Incubyte TDD Assessment

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
This repository contains my solution for the Incubyte TDD Assessment - Frontend. It's a fun little project that demonstrates how to use Test-Driven Development (TDD) to build a String Calculator. Along the way, I also created a simple and interactive user interface to make the calculator easy to use.

What's Inside? ðŸ¤”
The String Calculator can:

Add numbers from a string separated by commas or custom delimiters.
Handle newlines as delimiters (yep, you can mix commas and newlines!).
Throw an error if there are negative numbers and tell you exactly which ones caused the issue.
Let you use a clean, easy-to-understand web interface to try it out.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
